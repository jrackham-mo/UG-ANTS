class UnstructuredFilterABC(abc.ABC):
    """
    An abstract class from which specific types of mesh filter are derived.

    Represents a spatial operation defined on a given unstructured mesh, provided at
    creation time.  The operation itself will be defined by the inheriting subclass.

    The general operation of this will consist of several steps :

    * creation via :meth:`~ugants.filter.generic.UnstructuredFilterABC.__init__` :
      e.g. ``filter = FilterClass(cube[, *args, **kwargs])``

      The initial `__init__`, i.e. constructor call : this specifies and records
      the target mesh on which the filter operates.  Additional control arguments and
      keywords may also be provided, but these will be specific to the actual filter
      type (class).

    * call via :meth:`~ugants.filter.generic.UnstructuredFilterABC.__call__` :
      e.g. ``result_cube = filter(input_cube)``

      The actual filtering operation.  The input_cube, and the result, contain data on
      the same, originally-specifed filter mesh and location.
      The input cube can have different dimensions to the original, but its mesh
      (and hence mesh dimension length) must be the same.  The calculation will be
      repeated over non-mesh dimensions, and the result will have the same dimensions,
      and same mesh, as the input.

    Notes
    -----
    In defining a specific derived subclass, you define the
    :meth:`UnstructuredFilterABC.inner_filter` method, which is the core calculation.
    However, it will usually also be useful to override the '__init__' method.
    When providing an overriding '__init__' method, it is essential that this also
    calls the parent :meth:`UnstructuredFilterABC.__init__`.
