    The algorithm follows that outlined in section 4.1 of `this paper
    <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1265-2023>`_.

    Examples
    --------
    The following table shows three panels of the C4 cubed sphere, which is used here
    to illustrate creating stencils on an unstructured grid. The numbers in the table
    represent the cell indices. In the example below, cell 0 neighbours cells 1, 4, 51,
    and 64. Cell 50 neighbours cells 49, 51, 54, and 65.

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |               |67 |71 |75 |79 |
    +               +---+---+---+---+
    |               |66 |70 |74 |78 |
    +               +---+---+---+---+
    |               |65 |69 |73 |77 |
    +               +---+---+---+---+
    |               |64 |68 |72 |76 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |48 |49 |50 |51 |0  |1  |2  |3  |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |52 |53 |54 |55 |4  |5  |6  |7  |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |56 |57 |58 |59 |8  |9  |10 |11 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |60 |61 |62 |63 |12 |13 |14 |15 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    By default the stencil will only include the four immediate neighbours,
    plus the central cell itself:

    >>> stencil = Stencil(cube)
    >>> stencil[0]
    [0, 64, 1, 51, 4]
    >>> stencil[10]
    [6, 9, 10, 11, 14]

    Negative indices are permitted, and will be interpreted in the usual Python way,
    i.e. for a positive integer ``M``, the index ``-M`` will be replaced with ``N - M``
    where ``N`` is the length of the array. For example, index ``-1`` refers to the
    final element of the array, ``-2`` the penultimate element, etc. If the provided
    central index is negative, then it will appear in the
    returned list as its positive counterpart.

    >>> cube.shape
    (96,)
    >>> stencil[-96]
    [0, 64, 1, 51, 4]
    >>> stencil[-86]
    [6, 9, 10, 11, 14]

    Passing ``iterations=2`` generates an extended stencil with the eight
    surrounding cells, or seven if the central cell is on the corner of a face:

    >>> extended_stencil = Stencil(cube, iterations=2)
    >>> extended_stencil[0]
    [0, 64, 1, 51, 4, 68, 5, 55]
    >>> extended_stencil[10]
    [5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15]

    Further iterations can be specified if a larger neighbourhood is required:

    >>> third_iteration_stencil = Stencil(cube, iterations=3)
    >>> third_iteration_stencil[0]
    [0, 64, 1, 65, 4, 68, 5, 2, 69, 6, 8, 72, 9, 50, 51, 54, 55, 59]
    >>> third_iteration_stencil[10]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 80, 20, 84, 24, 88, 28]
